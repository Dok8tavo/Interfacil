# ‚ö° Interfacil

Interfacil is a Zig package for making and using interfaces easily in Zig. I'm doing a rewrite because the possible removal of the `usingnamespace` keyword.

Here are a few projects with similar purpose:

- [zig_interfaces by yglcode](https://github.com/yglcode/zig_interfaces),
- [zimpl by permutationlock](https://github.com/permutationlock/zimpl),
- [zig-interface by bluesillybeard](https://github.com/bluesillybeard/zig-interface),

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Usage

Make sure you're using zig 0.13.0. If you have trouble managing your zig versions, I can recommand one of those:

- [zvm](https://github.com/tristanisham/zvm)
- [zigup](https://github.com/marler8997/zigup)

1. Fetch the interfacil package into your `build.zig.zon`:

In your project folder with your `build.zig` and `build.zig.zon`, run this command:

```
zig fetch --save=interfacil https://api.github.com/repos/Dok8tavo/Interfacil/tarball
```

2. Get the interfacil module inside your `build.zig`:

In your `build.zig` file, in the `fn (b: *std.Build) !void` function, write:

```zig
const interfacil = b.dependency("interfacil", .{}).module("interfacil");
```

3. Link the interfacil module to your executable/library/test artifact, or your module:

```zig
your_build_artifact.root_module.addImport("interfacil", interfacil);
your_module.addImport("interfacil", interfacil);
```

4. Use the interfacil module in your source code using `@import("interfacil")`.

## üëç Implemented interfaces

- [Iterators](https://github.com/Dok8tavo/Interfacil/blob/main/src/iteration.zig#L27-L31): from `next` get:
  - `all/any`,
  - `nall/none`,
  - `collectAlloc/collectBuffer`,
  - `filter` and more,
  - `map` and more,
  - `reduce` and more,
